      "body": "Even for a fool, Patchface was a sorry thing. Perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter \nwith a quip, but the sea had taken that power from him, along with half his wits and all his \nmemory. He was soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles, incoherent as often as not. The \ngirl was the only one who laughed at him now, the only one who cared if he lived or died.\n An ugly little girl and a sad fool, and maester makes three... now there is a tale to make men \nweep. “Sit with me, child.” Cressen beckoned her closer. “This is early to come calling, scarce \npast dawn. You should be snug in your bed.” \n “I had bad dreams,” Shireen told him. “About the dragons. They were coming to eat me.” \n The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. “We \nhave talked of this before,” he said gently. “The dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of \nstone, child. In olden days, our island was the westernmost outpost of the great Freehold of \nValyria. It was the Valyrians who raised this citadel, and they had ways of shaping stone since \nlost to us. A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense. The \nValyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fear\u0002some, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple \ncrenellations.” He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle \nsqueeze. “So you see, there is nothing to fear.”\n Shireen was unconvinced. “What about the thing in the sky? Dalla and Matrice were talking by \nthe well, and Dalla said she heard the red woman tell Mother that it was dragonshreath. If the \ndragons are breathing, doesn’t that mean they are coming to life?” \n The red woman, Maester Cressen thought sourly. It’s enough that she’s filled the head of the \nmother with her madness, must she poison the daughter’s dreams as well? He would have a stern \nword with Dalla, warn her not to spread such tales. “The thing in the sky is a comet, sweet child. \nA star with a tail, lost in the heavens. It will be gone soon enough, never to be seen again in our \nlifetimes. Watch and see.” ",

      "body": "It was a Saturday afternoon, Obinze and Ifemelu were in the TV room,\nInyang was upstairs with Dike, Aunty Uju was in the kitchen with\nChikodili when the phone rang. Ifemelu picked it up. The voice on the\nother end, The General’s ADC, crackled through a bad connection, but\nwas still clear enough to give her details: the crash happened a few miles\noutside Jos, the bodies were charred, there were already rumors that the\nHead of State had engineered it to get rid of officers who he feared were\nplanning a coup. Ifemelu held the phone too tightly, stunned. Obinze\nwent with her to the kitchen, and stood by Aunty Uju as Ifemelu\nrepeated the ADC’s words.\n“You are lying,” Aunty Uju said. “It is a lie.”\nShe marched towards the phone, as though to challenge it, too, and\nthen she slid to the floor, a boneless, bereft sliding, and began to weep.\nIfemelu held her, cradled her, all of them unsure of what to do, and the\nsilence in between her sobs seemed too silent. Inyang brought Dike\ndownstairs.\n“Mama?” Dike said, looking puzzled.\n“Take Dike upstairs,” Obinze told Inyang.\nThere was banging on the gate. Two men and three women, relatives\nof The General, had bullied Adamu to open the gate, and now stood at\nthe front door, shouting. “Uju! Pack your things and get out now! Give\nus the car keys!” One of the women was skeletal, agitated and red-eyed,\nand as she shouted—“Common harlot! God forbid that you will touch\nour brother’s property! Prostitute! You will never live in peace in this\nLagos!”—she pulled her headscarf from her head and tied it tightly\naround her waist, in preparation for a fight. At first, Aunty Uju said\nnothing, staring at them, standing still at the door. Then she asked them\nto leave in a voice hoarse from tears, but the relatives’ shouting\nintensified, and so Aunty Uju turned to go back indoors. “Okay, don’t\ngo,” she said. “Just stay there. Stay there while I go and call my boys\nfrom the army barracks.”\nOnly then did they leave, telling her, “We are coming back with our\nown boys.” Only then did Aunty Uju begin to sob again. “I have nothing.\nEverything is in his name. Where will I take my son to now?”\nShe picked up the phone from its cradle and then stared at it,\nuncertain whom to call.\n",
